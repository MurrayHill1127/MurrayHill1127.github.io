成人的过程，就是重新发现自我的过程。

小婴儿的时候，自我心是百分百的。世界就得围着我转，天底下只有我高兴了才行。

渐渐地，上了幼儿园、小学，我大多数时候活在家庭之中，父母之下。得到父母的夸奖了，可以高兴好久；被爸妈批评后，可能愁眉苦脸一整天。

进入中学，更多的，是生活在同学、老师的氛围里。同学们追漂亮的鞋子，那我卯足了劲也要有一双；同学们玩好玩的游戏，那我怎么样也不能落后。潜意识里，我无论做什么，都想融进那个氛围，那个集体里去。

考上大学，慢慢成人。我渐渐明白了生活的奥义，那就是：生活是自己的，与他人无关。

仔细回想，我刚升上初中的时候，学习是最轻松的。那个时候开始住校，开始慢慢地脱离家庭，生活的重心转到学校上。那个时候我总是能考第一名，并且，我没有额外付出时间、精力。老师让上课就上课、吃饭就吃饭、睡觉就睡觉。还没学会攀比、还没学会焦虑。每天都很快活。

我后来常常思考，初一的那段日子,我能取得成功的关键，就是专注于自己的内心，不受到外面的影响。

现在我十九岁，差半年二十岁。我不知道我父辈的二十岁是怎么过的，我其实也不太清楚同龄人此刻的心态究竟怎么样。回顾过去的几年，主旋律是焦虑和迷茫。不过谁的青春不迷茫？大家都是在迷茫中走出一条自己的路来。

专注自己的内心，离开浅薄的事情，不要妄想、不要焦虑。

注销QQ空间、微信朋友圈。
关掉QQ、微信的提示铃声。
把手机上的所有视频软件、游戏都删掉。
手机设置 30 位密码，并且关闭指纹、面部解锁，增加打开手机的成本，把手机只当作工具来用。

这些是被动地切断与外界纷扰的联系，但有时还是会焦虑。

要制定计划，不要想一口吃成胖子，慢慢来。

要做事情，并且认真做。理想是崇高的，但日常的一点一滴是有点枯燥的。要自己从中寻找意义。

要听自己的声音。沉浸在自己的世界里。

像逃避毒品一样，逃避悲观和焦虑。乐观是可以练习的，就是说，一但脑子里出现打击自信心的想法，就转移注意力，做事情，强制自己不去想。


有时我看到一些成年人，有的时候和他们讲话，你能感觉到他们的自信。这种自信无关于学历，也无关于财富。更多的，是他们对自己的存在感到舒服，感到自信。这是世界观层面的事情。

有的时候想到做爸爸。父亲永远是威严又有慈爱，父亲身上似乎有用不完的自信。这种自信给妻子和孩子安全感。我以后也要成为这样的父亲吗？想到这儿我总是有些激动。

不要害怕路太难走。只要认准一条路走下去，羊肠小道也会走成康庄大道。希望等到未来的某一天，我走过的道路会开满鲜花，我的孩子在上面奔跑玩耍。
