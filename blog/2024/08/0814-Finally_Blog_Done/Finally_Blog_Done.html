    <h2 style="text-align: center;">Finally Blog Done</h2>
    <p class="right">August 14, 2024<br />Huai'an</p>
    <p>It is 5:22 a.m. , and I have finally finished my blog website. </p>

<p>I have been working on this blog for a long time, and I am so happy that it is finally done.</p>

<p>The coolest thing about this blog is that all the things are automated. I just need to write my blog in markdown, and the website will be updated automatically by a series of scripts.</p>

<p>Besides, I have also implemented a function like a file system, which you can find on Category page.</p>

<p>That's all, and now I must go to bed. Good morning and Good night.</p>
